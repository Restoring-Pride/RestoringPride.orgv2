## Our vision...

To see an end to chronic homeless once and for all.&nbsp; Where all members of the LGBTQ community have unrestricted access to stable housing as well as the services needed to become self-sufficient once again.

<p>Founded in 2019, Restoring Pride stands out among the services available today. &nbsp;Clients are back in control during their recovery.&nbsp; We cannot force recovery on someone and expect it work in the long term.
