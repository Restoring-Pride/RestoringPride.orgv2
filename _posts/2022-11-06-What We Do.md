Restoring Pride, Inc. is a non-profit organization providing safe, stable transitional housing for members of the LGBTQ community dealing with homelessness brought on by addiction. 

In the years ahead, our aspirational goal is to establish self-sustaining villages that offer accommodations for up to a year to members of the LGBTQ community who have found themselves homeless or without stable housing. These villages will offer counseling and other remediation services, minor medical services and a host of other solutions, co-located within the facility.
